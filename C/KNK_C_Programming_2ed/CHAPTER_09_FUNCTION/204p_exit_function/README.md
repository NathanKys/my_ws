# Exit function

By using `return 0;`, it would terminate its function.   
When it comes with **main** function, program would terminate.   
If you use `exit(0)` in **function which is not main function**, it would terminate program   instead of its very function.   
   
In stdlib.h, `EXIT_SUCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` defined as `0` and `1`   
`exit()` has a advantage of specifying excat location where to terminate program.
