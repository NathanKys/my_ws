# Type of main function

When main function returns `0`, program gets terminated.   
No matter what type you use, it should return `0`   
`0 == FALSE == '\0'`   
Recommended type of main function is `int` but other types are allowed as well.   
When it returns `-1` it stands for **termination of program with error**
